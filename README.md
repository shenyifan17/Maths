# Maths
Some advance maths learnt at spare time, just for fun! 

I did mostly analysis during my undergrad study, e.g. Metric and Topological Spaces, Functional Analysis, Proability and Measure, Measure and Integration. 

Doing some other topics just for fun. Topics might cover:

 - Advanced Probability Theory
 - Stats with Fat Tails 
 - Abstract Algebra (Galois Theory)
 - Coding and Cryptograph
 - Complex Systems
